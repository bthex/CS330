How do I approach designing software?
How do I approach developing programs?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How did iteration factor into your development?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approached this project like I would any other project. I started by picking what the end product was and then tried to split it into
managable chunks to complete and test. This project did work a little differently that other projects. I usually start form scratch. I think
I relied to much on the sample we were given. I didnt have a good enough grasp on what I was doing and the secitons that I had to complete were
more cumbersome becasue of this. I fell behind on what I wanted to compelete and along with turning in the milestones. 
I dont feel like I had any new development strategies for this course. I mostly felt I was trying to catch up so my plan from the beginning 
kind of went out the window. I did learn a lot from this project. I now know that I need to make the sections I am trying to develop a little 
smaller and use more of the timeline I am given. I also learned that it makes a big difference to start from scatch than try to use something
someone else made. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

This project was so much different than anything I have ever done. I dont really like how I put the project together. I usually create more functions to complete
what I need so that its easily resuseable. For this class I felt like I was trying to keep up and the code was put together poorly. I did complete the project but I am not
entirely haoppy with the final product or the code structure.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I want to get a software dev job in the future. I am working towards a computer science degree with a focus in software development. I have gotten a 
pretty wide range of classes sop far and all of them have helped me build my coding skills. I have a long ways to go but I am definately better after this class.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Before I took this class I felt that I was pretty good at getting a grasp on new skill when it came to coding. This class tought me that 
I have quite a lot to learn still. I had a hard time adding completing this project towards the end. I think that some of it had to with my 
own time restaints. I did not have as much time to play around with the code to get a better understanding. So the biggest take away froom this
class for me is that not everything can be understood easily. There will be times that I need to set blocked time up to learn a new skills when it 
comes to coding.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

For my professional career development I think that having even small amount of knowledge about multuiple facets of programming is good. It allows me to
use my experinces to complete tasks more efficently. I am not sure how much I will use what I learned in this class in the future. I know that I will definately
put in some more practice. It also helped me asked for help. This is the first class that I had to reach out to the professor becuase something wasnt 
working right. I need to be better about asking for help so this was a good stepping stone.
